# DB Seeder

DB Seeder is a utility designed to streamline the process of populating databases with meaningful test data. This tool simplifies the task of generating and inserting test data into SQL databases.

## Key Features

- **Speed**: Easily obtain a populated database with meaningful data and all necessary relationships.
- **Convenience**: No need to manually write data generation scripts.
- **Scalability**: Generate any amount of records, from tens to millions.

## How it Works

DB Seeder takes an SQL script as input, responsible for creating tables, and fills the database with test data according to that schema. This allows developers and testers to quickly set up databases for testing purposes without the hassle of writing complex data generation scripts.

## Installation

## Usage

## Example

Suppose you have an SQL script `schema.sql` defining tables `users`, `products`, and their relationships. Running DB Seeder with this script will populate your database with sample data for these tables.
